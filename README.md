## Javascript ToDo list! 
- I have made this spanished theme, thinking about how I could use this later on to help me practice and learn spanish words.

# ğŸ‘€ File Set up


# ğŸ‘€ How it works


# ğŸ‘€ Process (to help me remember later)
- I used two websites as reference to help me with the list
- I created the HTML and styled the page
- Created 'const' variables using document.querySelector to find parts of my html so I can use them later - const has been used as the     names of these wont change. 
- Let has been used as these variables will change later

# ğŸ‘€ Resources that helped me to create the todo list
